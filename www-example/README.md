Example
============

This directory contains a "minimal" example for a MMIR-based application.

(actually this is an empty application, since no ```controllers``` and no ```views```
 are specified; for a small working example see the [StarterKit][1] example application)
 
 
NOTE the [MMIR-library][2] code needs to be included / copied into a sub-folder ```mmirf/```
